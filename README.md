## CPU Architecture

- This is the 6503 CPU it is a Harvard Achitecture Bassed CPU it has seperate ROM and RAM for the system to access aswell as seperate data busses for it hence it is quicker to acess data and saves clock cycles
- The CPU has a Process Core Architecture Where The Sysytem reads from memory bassed on Where the process index tells the CPU from where to where to read and it allows the usser to seperate code into segments and execute them as and when they want and controll the flow of the software
- This is the fundumental CPU Architecture which is a harvard architecture PCA desinged system
