# 6503 CPU 
## introduction
- 6503 is a CPU developement project in which the goal of a project is to create a CPU like the 6502 computer but the goal is to create a machine bassed of my very own assembly language and logic
- the parameters this project must follow is that the entierety of the project is to be created throguh logic gate abstraction only and the goal is to create a computer solley ussing logic gates and make a functional version
### Parameters
- The conditions the CPU must satisfy are
- It must read memory and be able to travel to any adress up an instruction
- it must be able to control IO by taking input and output
- it has to be able to read and write to a seperate memory allocation
- it has to be 16 bit in terms of addressing space
- it must be able to do basic mathematical operations
